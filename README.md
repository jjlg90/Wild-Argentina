### Skeleton
For the wireframes, Figma software has been used to lay out the foundations of the website.

Check out the [Wireframes]() here!

### Surface
 The content is easy to navigate and is neatly divided in sections.

 The colour palette is dark, looking to highlight the brightness of the images to attract attention to them. 

* Blue and Grey for backgrounds
    * #263238
    * #607d8b 
    * #546e7a 
    * #455a64 
    * #37474f 
    * #424242
    * #212121

* White and Yellow for fonts
    * #fafafa
    * #faff00 

* Red and Green for buttons
    * #f44336
    * #4caf50



The fonts are:
* Montserrat. Bold and with a strong connection to the content. "The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires 
  inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century."
* Lora. In order to provide a nice contrast with the headers, with its brushed curves and roots in calligraphy, Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif.
